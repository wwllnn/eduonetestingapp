     foliage on the breast of the fostering earth, if
     the dew and the rain draw it forth;
    So doth my tender mind flourish, if it be fed with the
     sweet dew of the fostering spirit,
    Lacking this, it beginneth straightway to languish,
     even as a floweret born upon dry earth, if the
     dew and the rain tend it not.`,

    Ecologists have long wondered how thousands of microscopic phytoplankton species can live together near ocean surfaces competing for the same resources.

Ecologists’ many efforts to explain this phenomenon still haven’t uncovered a satisfactory explanation.
    
     
    
    Text 2
    
    Ecologist Michael Behrenfeld and colleagues have connected phytoplankton’s diversity to their microscopic size. Because these organisms are so tiny, they are spaced relatively far apart from each other in ocean water and, moreover, experience that water as a relatively dense substance. This in turn makes it hard for them to move around and interact with one another. Therefore, says Behrenfeld’s team, direct competition among phytoplankton probably happens much less than previously thought.`,

    passage: 'Perovskite solar cells convert light into electricity more efficiently than earlier kinds of solar cells, and manufacturing advances have recently made them commercially attractive. One limitation of the cells, however, has to do with their electron transport layer (ETL), through which absorbed electrons must pass. Often the ETL is applied through a process called spin coating, but such ETLs are fairly inefficient at converting input power to output power. André Taylor and colleagues tested a novel spray coating method for applying the ETL. The team produced ETLs of various thicknesses and concluded that spray coating holds promise for improving the power conversion efficiency of ETLs in perovskite solar cells.',
    question: 'Which choice best describes data from the graph that support Taylor and colleagues’ conclusion?',
    choice1: 'Both the ETL applied through spin coating and the ETL applied through spray coating showed a power conversion efficiency greater than 10% at their lowest performing thickness.',
    choice2: 'The lowest performing ETL applied through spray coating had a higher power conversion efficiency than the highest performing ETL applied through spin coating.',
    choice3: 'The highest performing ETL applied through spray coating showed a power conversion efficiency of approximately 13%, while the highest performing ETL applied through spin coating showed a power conversion efficiency of approximately 11%.',
    choice4: 'There was a substantial difference in power conversion efficiency between the lowest and highest performing ETLs applied through spray coating.',
    answer: 'B'
